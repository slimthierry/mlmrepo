# Notes taken from the DataURI RFC

The <mediatype> is an Internet media type specification (with
optional parameters.) The appearance of ";base64" means that the data
is encoded as base64. Without ";base64", the data (as a sequence of
octets) is represented using ASCII encoding for octets inside the
range of safe URL characters and using the standard %xx hex encoding
of URLs for octets outside that range.  If <mediatype> is omitted, it
defaults to text/plain;charset=US-ASCII.  As a shorthand,
"text/plain" can be omitted but the charset parameter supplied.

The "data:" URL scheme is only useful for short values. Note that
some applications that use URLs may impose a length limit; for
example, URLs embedded within <A> anchors in HTML have a length limit
determined by the SGML declaration for HTML [RFC1866]. The LITLEN
(1024) limits the number of characters which can appear in a single
attribute value literal, the ATTSPLEN (2100) limits the sum of all
lengths of all attribute value specifications which appear in a tag,
and the TAGLEN (2100) limits the overall length of a tag.

## Syntax

dataurl    := "data:" [ mediatype ] [ ";base64" ] "," data
mediatype  := [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter )
data :=*urlchar
parameter  := attribute "=" value
